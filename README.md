# AI-Based-Wage-Gap-Detection-in-India
This project examines wage patterns across industries such as silk, leather, construction, and small-scale manufacturing to identify gaps between actual compensation and fair wages. Many workers are underpaid due to outdated laws, contractual loopholes, and weak enforcement. The proposed AI system gathers wage data, industry standards, and labor regulations to detect underpayment patterns. Machine-learning models predict fair wages based on skill, experience, productivity, and industry benchmarks, then compare them with actual pay to pinpoint the legal rule or contract clause causing discrepancies. The system serves as a decision-support tool for policymakers, NGOs, and labor groups, helping identify unfair provisions and propose reforms. The approach combines economics, labor law, and ML-based policy evaluation to foster fair compensation.
